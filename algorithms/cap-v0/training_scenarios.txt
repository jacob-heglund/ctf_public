These are the scenarios Denis used for his training:
0. Find the flag (single) - Fully observable, 1 blue, 0 red

1. Find the flag (team) - Fully observable, 4 blue, 0 red

2. First encounter with enemies - Fully observable, 4 blue, 4 red
- uses transfer learning from experiment 1

3. Fog of war - Partially observable, 4 blue, 4 red
- uses transfer learning from experiment 2

4. Fog of war with UAVs helping - Partially observable, 4 blue, 4 red
- uses transfer learning from experiment 2
